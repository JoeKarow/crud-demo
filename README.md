## How It's Made

### Tech Stack

- HTML
- JavaScript
- EJS templating
- MongoDB
- Express
- ~~CSS~~ No styling for extra crud factor.

The beginning of @zellwk's tutorial states that they wanted to write a "comprehensive tutorial." They certainly weren't lying.
This project was made by following along with the blog post and taking some liberties here and there. (I'm probably the one engineer who isn't a Star Wars fan. <sub>*Please don't nerdrage me.*</sub>)

## Lessons Learned

- MongoDB works great with my JavaScript oriented brain.
- Trying to figure out a way to grab a random record took a few different tries. It's quite obvious why this would take some finageling - why *would* anyone want to arbitrarily grab a random record and change it to troll a Prius owner?
- Toyota's heart was in the right place starting in 2001 - but they really should have given the design team some more resources.
- Use [`pnPm`](https://pnpm.io/) if you value free hard drive space and a readable `node_modules` directory structure.
